# View Transition Compatibility Fix

## Problem

Firefox doesn't support the View Transitions API, which was causing the website to go blank when users visited it with Firefox. The issue was that view-transition-specific CSS was being applied without proper fallbacks for unsupported browsers.

## Solution

I've centralized the view transition logic and added proper fallbacks for browsers that don't support the View Transitions API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ViewTransition.svelte Component

**File:** `src/lib/data/ViewTransition.svelte`

- Added detection for View Transition API support
- Added body classes to indicate support level:
  - `view-transitions-supported` for supporting browsers
  - `view-transitions-not-supported` for unsupported browsers
- Wrapped all view transition CSS in `@supports (view-transition-name: none)` queries
- Added fallback styles for unsupported browsers using `@supports not (view-transition-name: none)`
- Exported utility function `hasViewTransitionSupport()` for other components

### 2. Product.svelte Component Updates

**File:** `src/lib/components/products/Product.svelte`

- Wrapped view transition animations in `@supports (view-transition-name: none)`
- Added fallback animations for browsers without support
- Ensured proper fallback enlarge animation for product cards

### 3. Products Page Updates

**File:** `src/routes/products/+page.svelte`

- Protected view transition styles with `@supports` queries
- Added fallback transitions for product elements

### 4. PhotoGallery Component Updates

**File:** `src/lib/components/gallery/PhotoGallery.svelte`

- Added browser environment check
- Protected view transition styles with `@supports` queries
- Added fallback transitions for slide elements
- Enhanced JavaScript checks for view transition support

### 5. Product Functions Updates

**File:** `src/lib/components/products/productFunctions.js`

- Wrapped dynamically generated view transition CSS in `@supports` queries

## How It Works

### For Supporting Browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

- Full View Transitions API functionality
- Smooth page transitions and product enlargements
- All original animations and effects

### For Non-Supporting Browsers (Firefox, older browsers)

- Graceful fallback to CSS transitions
- No blank pages or broken layouts
- Equivalent visual experience with simpler animations
- Body class `view-transitions-not-supported` for additional targeting

## Browser Support Matrix

| Browser        | View Transitions | Fallback           |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Chrome 111+    | ✅ Full Support  | N/A                |
| Edge 111+      | ✅ Full Support  | N/A                |
| Safari 18+     | ✅ Full Support  | N/A                |
| Firefox        | ❌ Not Supported | ✅ CSS Transitions |
| Older Browsers | ❌ Not Supported | ✅ CSS Transitions |

## Testing

To test the fallback behavior:

1. Open developer tools
2. Go to Console
3. Run: `delete document.startViewTransition`
4. Reload the page
5. The site should work with fallback animations

## Benefits

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works on all modern browsers
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhanced experience for supporting browsers
3. **Centralized Logic**: All view transition code is now in one place
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to update or disable view transitions globally
5. **Performance**: No JavaScript errors or layout issues on unsupported browsers

## Future Considerations

- As Firefox adds View Transitions API support, no code changes will be needed
- The body classes can be used for additional browser-specific styling
- The centralized approach makes it easy to add new view transition effects

This fix ensures that your website works perfectly across all browsers while providing enhanced experiences where possible.
